	<script src="jspm_packages/system.js"></script>
	<!-- Next we have config.js. This contains configuration for the loader. 
		It's generated automatically whenever you execute a jspm command. 
		jspm is the client-side package manager we recommend because 
		it provides an amazing developer experience by integrating 
		client-side package management with an ES6 compliant module loader. -->
	<script src="config.js"></script>
	<!-- Once we have our module loader and its configuration, 
		we load the aurelia-bootstrapper module with a call to System.import.
		When the bootstrapper loads it inspects the HTML document for aurelia-app attributes. 
		In this case it will find that the body has an aurelia-app attribute. 
		This tells the bootstrapper to load our app view-model and its view, 
		conventionally located in app.js and app.html 
		and then compose them as an Aurelia application in the DOM. -->
